Ways in which we can model people:
* Rational Actor Models: 
    Assume there is a mathematical function mapped to human behavior.
    Optimize this to obtain maximum use for the person
    ex: utility = C^.5*L^.5 (C = consumption, L = liesure)
    Not an exact formula. Try to come closer
* Behavioral Models
    Observe what people do (not rational)
    Neuroscience helps in understanding how people think. 
* Rule Based Models
    Assume people follow rules. derive simple rules it should map nicely if the simpler rules are closer to what people do.
    Schelling model: 

- Rational Actor Model:
    Assume people have some kind of objective (goal). Given the objective, people tries to optimize the objective.
    ex: Firm - maximize profits (make the choice that maximizes this)
        Individual - maximize utility
        Political Candidate - maximize votes
    Firm example: Revenue = price * quantity
        quantity = q
        price = 50 - q
        what q should be chosen to maximize revenue? optimal choice is q = 25
    Where to apply?
        Investments
        Purchases
        Education Level (level of schooling)
        vote
    When we assume rationality, people always think it as selfish. But rationality depends on objective function. In case of selfishness, objective function is always "me".
    
    Decision vs Game:
    - Decision: Payoff depends on what I do.
    - Game: Payoff depends on what others do.
    Game theory assumes other persons are rational. This is always good to assume others as rational.

    When do we see rationality: 
    Large Stakes: when stakes are high, rationality is always present. People tend to think rationally when they have to take huge decisions
    Repeated: 
    Group Decisions:
